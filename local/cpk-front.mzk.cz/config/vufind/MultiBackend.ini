; (Optional) The name of a driver instance to use by default if no specific
; instance can be determined as the best option (must correspond with a key
; from the [Drivers] section below if set -- omit to have no default driver)
;default_driver = "instance1"

; This section is for declaring which driver to use for each institution.
; The key should be the Source ID of a specific institution, and the value
; should be the name of an ILS driver.
;      Example: instance1 = Voyager
; In this case, the Voyager driver would be loaded and configured using an
; instance1.ini file (which you should create as a copy of Voyager.ini).
