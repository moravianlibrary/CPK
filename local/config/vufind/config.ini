; Multiple targets may be separated by commas.  Do not use qualifiers unless you

; Zotero.
[OpenURL]
; If a resolver base URL is enabled, it will be used to link ISSNs to your link
; resolver and to access articles in Summon if that module is enabled.  Earlier
; versions of VuFind included some parameters as part of the URL; at this point,
; any extra parameters will be ignored -- please provide only the base URL.
;url             = "http://openurl.myuniversity.edu/sfx_local"

; This string will be included as part of your OpenURL referer ID (the full string
; will be "info:sid/[your rfr_id setting]:generator").  You may be able to configure
; special behavior in your link resolver based on this ID -- for example, you may
; wish to prevent the resolver from linking to VuFind when links came from VuFind
; (to avoid putting a user in an infinite loop).
rfr_id          = vufind.svn.sourceforge.net

;resolver        = sfx

; When embed is true and this is set to true results from the link resolver will
; be loaded automatically (default is false, which requires a user click to trigger
; the loading). Alternatively you can provide a comma-separated list of view areas
; (cf. show_in_* settings) to autoload embedded OpenURLs only in certain views.
; Notice: autoloading in results view might put some load on your linkresolver (each
; results view could perform searches.ini->[General]->default_limit requests). You

; below).
embed_auto_load = false

; When embed is true, you can set this to an absolute path on your system in order

; These settings control what events are logged and where the information is
; stored.
;
; VuFind currently supports four logging levels: alert (severe fatal error),
; error (fatal error), notice (non-fatal warning) and debug (informational).
;
; Each logging level can be further broken down into five levels of verbosity.
; You can specify the desired level by adding a dash and a number after the
; level in the configuration string -- for example, alert-2 or error-5.
; The higher the number, the more detailed the logging messages.  If verbosity
; is not specified, it defaults to 1 (least detailed).
;
; Several logging methods are available, and each may be configured to log any
; combination of levels.
;
; You may enable multiple logging mechanisms if you want -- in fact, it is
; recommended, since the failure of one logging mechanism (i.e. database down,
; file system full) may then be reported to another.
;
; If database is uncommented, messages will be logged to the named MySQL table.
; The table can be created with this SQL statement:
; CREATE TABLE log_table ( id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
;     logtime TIMESTAMP NOT NULL, ident CHAR(16) NOT NULL,
;     priority INT NOT NULL, message TEXT, PRIMARY KEY (id) );
;
; If file is uncommented, messages will be logged to the named file.  Be sure
; that Apache has permission to write to the specified file!
;
; If email is uncommented, messages will be sent to the provided email address.
; Be careful with this setting: a flood of errors can easily bog down your mail
; server!
